This is an old project of mine developed with an university collegue and friend for our master thesis.

Currently this project is deprecated because it uses a very old version of appengine and its master-slave datastore but the idea is still good and usefull.

With this framework you can build genetical alghoritm upon the google cloud and parallelize it using the map-reduce model. 

The idea was that the framework took care of the parallelization and rappresentation of the algorithm in a map-reduce model, the user must implements the chromosome and the optimization function. You can also specify some custom temination criteria.
